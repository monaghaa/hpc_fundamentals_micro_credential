## Exercise 1: Building Software with Spack

**Objectives:**
1) Create a Spack environment
2) Install fastqc in your Spack environment

First, load the spack module. 

`module load spack`

Note that Spack uses the system compilers by default.
```
which gcc
gcc --version
```

Create a Spack environment.
`spack env create fastqc_env`


Activate your new spack environment. 
	Tip: You can use tab completion for spack environments!
`spacktivate fastqc_env`


View the output of `spack info fastqc`.

Let's see which packages are required for a complete fastqc installation.
`spack spec fastqc`


Now install fastqc v 0.11.9  **within your environment**:
`spack install --add fastqc@0.11.9`
Note: the installation will take ~10 minutes to complete.

Try the following commands:
```
spack env status
spack find 
spack find -p fastqc
```
Notice that the last command gives you version info for fastqc and lists the location of the installation. What is in the listed directory?

Deactivate your environment with `despacktivate`

Now let's try building fastqc with a different compiler. Compilers can take a *very* long time to build, but Spack lets you add compilers that are already installed.
`spack compiler add /curc/sw/install/gcc/10.3.0`


We'll need to create a new environment.
```
spack env create fastqc_gcc1030_env
spacktivate fastqc_gcc1030_env
```

Now you can install a fastqc built with gcc 10.3.0. Note that you don't have to complete this step for this tutorial.
`spack install --add fastqc%gcc@10.3.0`

When the `fastqc%gcc@10.3.0` installation is complete, the output of `spack find fastqc` from **a deactivated environment** should look like this:
```
-- linux-rhel8-zen / gcc@8.5.0 ----------------------------------
fastqc@0.11.9

-- linux-rhel8-zen3 / gcc@10.3.0 --------------------------------
fastqc@0.11.9
==> 2 installed packages
```

## Exercise 2: Installing Software with Mamba

**Objectives:**
1) Create a conda environment and install samtools 
2) Run samtools from within the environment

**Estimated time to complete**: 15 minutes

### **Step 1**: Create a mamba environment containing `samtools`.

> **_NOTE:_** Mamba environments must be created and run from a compute node (not a login node).`

Load the default miniforge module.
`module load miniforge`

What happened to your prompt? Which mamba environment are you in?

Create a mamba environment and install samtools.
`mamba create -n samtools_env -c bioconda samtools`

Did you get an error message? Hint:

```
mamba config --show channels
mamba config -h
```

Enter `y` for 'yes' when asked if you want to proceed.

### **Step 2**: Activate the environment and run samtools.

```
mamba activate samtools_env
samtools --help
```
What happened to your prompt after you activated `samtools_env`?

### Relevant CURC Documentation 

https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software/python.html

### Useful Mamba Commands (try if you have time)
```
mamba env list  # list all environments
mamba list      # list packages in active env
mamba env remove -n <envname>   # remove an environment
mamba config --show channels    # view configured channels
mamba deactivate    # deactivate environment
mamba create --name <clonedenv> --clone <envtoclone> # clone an environment
```

## Exercise 3: Installing Software With Apptainer (formerly Singularity)

**Objectives:**
1) Become familiar with basic `apptainer` commands.
2) Pull an image from a pre-built container, then run the program from the container. 

**Estimated time to complete**: 15 minutes

### Basic `apptainer` commands

View a list of Apptainer commands.
`apptainer --help`

Look at CURC's collection of pre-build containers.
```
echo $CURC_CONTAINER_DIR
ls $CURC_CONTAINER_DIR
```

An Apptainer Definition File (or “def file” for short) is like a set of blueprints explaining how to build a custom container. It includes specifics about the base OS to build or the base container to start from, software to install, environment variables to set at runtime, files to add from the host system, and container metadata. More information from the Apptainer user guide: https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/definition_files.html

Check out the definition file for the `mach3_build.sif` container.
SIF = **S**ingularity **I**mage **F**ile
`apptainer inspect --deffile $CURC_CONTAINER_DIR/mach3_build.sif`


Running programs from a container uses the following syntax:
`apptainer exec <name.sif> <program command> <options>`


For example:
`apptainer exec $CURC_CONTAINER_DIR/seurat_4.1.0.sif R`

###  Pull an image from a pre-built container, then run the program from the container. 
We are going to create a containerized version of samtools using the Docker image found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/staphb/samtools

Note that, by default, the cache directory for Apptainer builds is `/scratch/alpine/$USER`.
```
echo $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR 
```

Use the `apptainer pull` command to create a `.sif` file from the Docker image (here we place the created image in `/projects/$USER/samtools.sif`): 
`apptainer pull /projects/$USER/samtools.sif docker://staphb/samtools`


Run samtools from the container. Is it the same version of samtools you got from Mamba and building from source? 

Bonus question: How do `samtools_env`, `samtools.sif`, and the source installation compare in size?
